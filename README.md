The first logic using || (OR) is the correct and secure implementation for checking NFT transfer approvals. Here's why:

Secure Version (OR condition):
<code>
require(
    msg.sender == tokenOwner || token.getApproved(tokenIds[i]) == address(this),
    "Not approved or not owner"
);
</code>

Why the OR (||) is correct:
Owner can always transfer - If msg.sender is the owner, they don't need approval

Approved address can transfer - If the contract is approved for the token, it can transfer

Either condition satisfies - Only one needs to be true for a valid transfer

Why the AND (&&) version is wrong:
solidity
require(
    msg.sender == tokenOwner && token.getApproved(tokenIds[i]) == address(this),
    "Not approved or not owner"
);
This would require BOTH conditions to be true:

The sender must be owner AND

The contract must be approved

This is incorrect because:

Owners shouldn't need approval to transfer their own tokens

It would break standard NFT behavior where owners can always transfer

It's unnecessarily restrictive

Additional Security Considerations:
For ERC721 this is the standard approval check pattern

For ERC1155 you'd use isApprovedForAll instead

Best practice is to also check the token exists before calling ownerOf()

Consider adding a reentrancy guard if transferring multiple tokens

The OR version matches the security model of ERC721 where either:

You own the token, or

You've been approved to transfer it

This is how marketplaces like OpenSea are able to transfer tokens on behalf of users who have approved them.
